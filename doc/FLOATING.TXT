JEB -- The Interactive Android Decompiler

> FLOATING LICENSES

Floating builds provide more flexibility than individual builds, and can be distributed to many users within an organization.

The client (referred to as "JEB") as well as the server (referred to as the "Controller") are the same binary files: there is no separate package for the Controller.

When starting and during its execution, JEB will regularly probe the Controller to determine whether or not it is allowed to run.
This check is based on the number of seats available in your licensed build: eg, a floating license for 5 seats allows 5 different users to run JEB concurrently.

In order to start the Controller, use the '--controller' flag. Example, if the controller runs on a Linux machine:
  $ jeb_linux.sh --controller

In order to start JEB, proceed as usual, for instance on Windows:
  $ jeb_wincon.bat file.apk

Notes:
- The '--controller' flag is not available if the build is not a floating build: this can be checked by running JEB with the '--license' flag.
- The Controller must be started before the clients.
- An instance of JEB regularly contact the Controller. Therefore, the Controller should always be reachable by running instances of JEB. In order to minimize potential problems due to network latency, it is recommended to run JEB and the Controller within the same local network.
- By default, the Controller listens on all interfaces, on port 23477. This can be changed by setting the 'ctl_interface' and 'ctl_port' in the configuration file. Please refer to the manual for more information on the configuration file.
- The protocol used is compatible with HTTP.
- JEB instances and the Controller may be run in different environments (as in the example above, Controller on Linux, JEB on Windows, etc.)
